### `Overview`
This app is a burger logger that uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. It follows the MVC design pattern.

### `Description`
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
